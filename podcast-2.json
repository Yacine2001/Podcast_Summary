We've not been together for a few weeks So nice we got plenty to talk about and we've been delivered a game where we could fill three or four podcasts in it I mean the dust is hardly settled Gary, but what are your thoughts? Yeah, I mean Grateful to have been a match like that the last game I did was Southampton Arsenal where there was a Brilliant finish and this game was such a strange game in so many ways But the ending was just spectacular and the type of ending That we all like to see where there's loads of goals loads of instant It's frantic managers look like they could get sent off pulling hamstrings Ryan Mason's charging down the touchline But such a bizarre game but probably sums up where both teams have been at this season that There are mess at times during games But then they've still got really talented players out on the pitch who deliver individual moments of absolute quality I mean Liverpool raced into a start. It looked as though Spurs were going to reprise that awful day last Sunday at Newcastle. Yeah, and look At three three hours you sort of stop here on the gantry and it doesn't excuse that first half an hour You can say well done to Spurs for coming back But you can also say look you're a shambolic mess and that that shouldn't happen because it happens Three times in the last week, you know, you've gone five down against Newcastle two down against Manchester United and three down against Liverpool So you're not learning you do it can happen once you can have freak games But not three times in a week. So for me Spurs A mess at the start of the match Liverpool really played well But you know, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that Liverpool start quick at Anfield. It's what they've done for I don't know probably the whole history It's always been the same here and Spurs just weren't ready for it at all And before the game I had some confidence that it would be better coming out of the Manchester United second half on Thursday So look, it was a real mess for Spurs and you know I laid into them for that first half an hour from the ownership to choice of managers the job The managers have done and the players out on the pitch. They all take responsibility When when things are as bad because in the last two or three four months, it's It's fallen to pieces and look it's happened. It's happened at Chelsea when they've obviously sacked a manager and then obviously it's just completely gone Same at Manchester United last season They're the two most recent examples that I can think of Where you think you can just get by to the end of the season and it just doesn't work like that And you can actually end up in a real sort of mess wanting the season to end immediately And at three and a half an hour 20 minutes Sorry, you know you're cutting to Daniel Levy you cut into the Spurs fans were walking out and heading back home on the m6 and m1 And you've got the players on the pitch you were thinking they want the ground to swallow them up So it was a real mess, but Liverpool started well and Deserved to be three and a little in front and you thought it was going to be at that point five six six Seven but something happened didn't it? I don't think either of us know what happened But even before Harry Kane got one goal back they were in with a couple of other chances as well Liverpool switch off. Yeah, Liverpool got complacent and started to play passive possession They started just to knock it around and think we'll just sort of if you like not penetrate anymore and not play with purpose There was real speed and tempo in the first 25 minutes And when you stop doing that you allow a team somehow to build Tottenham were done. They were on the ground, but you start to allow them to get up and recover and just all of a sudden Think well hang on a minute. They've not scored four yet They've not scored five before you know it you get a chance. I think sonnets the post and then They score and before you know it you've got a little bit of an anxious feeling Can i say on that right hand side of the nightmare today from 40 minutes in how much is that down to the fact? Alexander-Arnold isn't playing as a normal right back. I was just going to say you have to connect the two They can't keep papering over the cracks. You've got to deal with it properly You know every chance that Tottenham had it felt like came down that right hand side And I love Trent on the ball. I love I love him when he gets on the ball centrally I love him when he gets on the ball on the right hand side But you can't expect you know I would say let's if they were going to a back three And Robertson was tucking round and allowing Canati to go over to that side But they're not going to a back three. Robertson's flying forward as well So you're expecting Canati to play right back and right centre back And that's too big an ask It can be done I had Yat Stapp, Yap Stam, I had Rio Ferdinand who were World-class defenders who could do it and quite often me and the other fullback whoever it was with Denis Ewing or Patrice Everer or Jon O'Shea or my brother would go forward. We'd both go forward together We'd fly on and we'd have Ronnie Jonsson and Yap Stam or Rio Ferdinand in my team And they basically deal 2 v 2 with a midfield player back, you know Roy Keane or Michael Carrick But if you're not quite right and you're not in quite a right season and your form's not right And you're giving teams encouragement and you can seed in goals. It just doesn't work like that You've got to be at the very top of your game to be able to get away with it And Liverpool aren't at that at this moment in time And I've bought into some of the thought this season it exists It's right Liverpool's midfield needs dealing with oh, they're not getting protected like they used to the pressing They're not pressing as hard They're not pressing as high they're not pressing and getting to the ball quickly Which means that you can get at the back four I played a lot in teams where you could get our back four But you still have to do your job better than Liverpool's defenders are doing They've got to do better than that. I hold them completely responsible today for me Look Elliot and Jones in midfield with Fabinho were they magnificent? No, but they did not cause the problem of Liverpool conceding goals today They were all over the place at the back and they really did allow Tottenham back in this game They did and once that first goal went in you knew that something might happen But the game in the second half Martin and it was drifting away I think we summarised it didn't we always said I think no one wants to take the extra risk Tottenham didn't want to go get beat five and Liverpool were wary that it could go to 3-2 And then it did go to 3-2 Yeah and for 20 minutes the game was like that and you thought I bet both managers went and shook hands with each other on the byline On the touch line here if they could obviously they can't they probably would have done it and said let's get out of here You know Ryan you've not been battered and demoralised and sort of embarrassed And we've not if you like sort of if you like lost a three goal lead But then once that second goal went in I almost knew that Tottenham would score again You're feeling you could sense it what I didn't anticipate Richard Alex It was that then they go and get a fourth Liverpool but you know it was a good comeback from Spurs And they have to be I'm not going to say congratulated They have to be what's less than congratulated but you know you give them some credit I give them some credit for keeping going Well they kept going for longer than they were really bad if you see what I mean Yeah yeah they kept going and look they didn't throw the towel in They kept plugging away I think a confident ruthless Jurgen Klopp Liverpool would have destroyed them I mean completely destroyed them They were lucky today that they weren't playing against a confident Liverpool defence And a confident Liverpool team because they would have been pulled apart here six seven eight Like Liverpool did to Manchester United But Liverpool aren't in that moment they're not playing that well They play well in moments in games they've got some good individuals But structurally it's just not right So Jurgen Klopp will have to sort that out in the summer But for Spurs to get back into the game at 3-3 which those celebrations were wild with a I wouldn't say half empty end but I'd probably say three quarters You know there was a big sort of lot of empty seats over this far side A lot of Spurs fans had gone home And they had a brilliant second half those Tottenham fans and then that I mean I can't really summarise it any better than I did on commentary So that is the most Tottenham thing that I've ever seen It's like oh you've come back to 3-3 and then you go and concede a goal in the sort of 90s From an experienced player who was obviously devastated by his leaving the club at the end of the season Yeah And it's not the way to go out is it? They've got a lot of experienced players Spurs Yeah They've got a lot of experienced players and they should be doing a lot better They should be doing a lot better I mean look it's a mistake The mistake he made actually I think he's just not hoofing it up the field I think trying to play it back there really when the balls come into you And you just scored the third goal You know even if he kicks it forward there's two things One it's as far away from your goal as possible And the second thing is you might have to get a counter-attack and get a fourth yourself You're better off controlling it than doing what he did You know composing yourself and controlling it He sort of got stuck in between everything more And I feel sorry for him a little bit Because it happens and I don't want to see anyone give a goal away But it was a brilliant end to the game and something that I didn't expect I expected today somehow to see a game where Manchester United had won and Newcastle had won It was almost a little bit like Taking Champions League football out of the equation really It might not but I mean it looks that way now It does I think Manchester United have got a little bit of a better chance It does, you know I think Manchester United have got a game at Brighton on Thursday I thought if they drop points today and then You know Brighton do something or if Newcastle lose somehow Brighton won't revenge for Wembley Yeah, so something could happen But they're both in very good positions Newcastle and Manchester United and they deserved it over the season So I think they'll go and finish it off Is what I think but you know Keep going, if you're Liverpool you've got to keep those two teams honest Newcastle have got Arsenal next week Manchester United have got Brighton So there's some difficult games to play But it was an incredible finish to the game One that I didn't expect but just summarised I think where both clubs are at at this moment in time They both need to get to summer as quickly as possible Because it's Below par For spurs in the last two or three months For Liverpool for much of the season really You know compared to the standards that they've set Most of our podcasts have concluded But we're going to do it now Nowhere near the conclusion Are you telling us that Manchester City are going to win the league And now They're top of the league And we've watched them before Up on these monitors here I've been asked on every Sky Sports production And every Sky Sports podcast for the last three months I think everyone was like queuing up The amount of times I'd said it Yeah I think they will win the league Look there's still things can happen We have seen it where a team Struggles like Arsenal have done in the last few weeks A powerful team Goes in front of them but then they wobble Somehow and basically Arsenal Wobble today to be fair I actually thought they could draw today I said in midweek it would be a tough game for them And it was a tough game Really tough game I thought Fulham did well in the game When you're in the game against City With 5-10 minutes to go you're always thinking there can be a chance The year That City won the league for the first time Manchester United got back In front of them and you thought here we go Manchester United got the power forward and they didn't, they stumbled So Arsenal have got to keep going It's about keeping teams honest at this time of the year I use that phrase a lot At 4 or 5 games to go What you'd hate to be in a position I had this in my first season at Manchester United Where we didn't win at West Ham And then Liverpool, sorry Blackburn didn't win at Liverpool And if we'd have won at West Ham we'd have won the league So you just want to make sure you do your job And I think if you, Arsenal Make sure you're not looking back in three weeks Thinking oh we thought we'd lost it But if we'd beat Chelsea and we'd beat Newcastle We actually would have won it because City have dropped a couple of points along the way Or a few points so We're somehow trying to recover for Tuesday night against Chelsea And Sunday against Spurs We're doing the game next week But at this moment in time, City This is where it reminds me So much of the seasons where we were In March and he'd walk in He'd say right I've had enough Stop messing around, you've been bored for the last couple of months Because there was no, the games didn't feel Important enough for us to get up for them That sounds really stupid I saw Gundogan's interview today It really resonated with me where he said that the Game was the game that sort of like meant It woke them up And I get that, there was a game where you think that's enough now Enough of that rubbish You know conceding to one of the bottom teams in the league With two minutes to go, well done to Nottingham Forest But that's not what you do if you're at the top of the league And I think that was the last game Where Pep Guardiola was rotating And fidgeting around With his team and back four I think since then it's got really serious And they've had to switch on and that resonates with me From where we were at times, Sir Alex Ferguson Was a rotator, he would Give the squad And trust the squad, but they'd come a point Where it was like, right, this is it And I want seriousness from you now, concentration And you'd really then start To get serious about everything And that's what City have done, they've got serious about The work And Arsenal have wobbled I didn't think they'd wobbled here Because I think here we've just seen what can happen here And strange things happen out there At Anfield, so I thought that was a game Where they played brilliant football, but you know You're tuned up against West Ham when you draw against The bottom of the league And then you go and not perform They didn't perform on Wednesday They didn't turn up And that's really disappointing That's the biggest game of their lives I don't buy into this gulf between The two teams point that's being made That wasn't a gulf, that was a team Not turning up, freezing Not having the sort of Ability to go into that game Because of what had happened against Southampton I think the Southampton game had demoralised them And I don't blame them, you know, I've been there Where I think that game really killed them on the Friday night That was a real blow Hammer blow And I think it was difficult for them to get The minds right for the City game And City were just doing what they do Which is power forward in big games I said on this podcast A week or two ago City will be looking forward to this match Pep Guardiola will be loving this match Michael Arteta and his players had to look forward To it in the same way And it didn't happen Erling Haaland, 50 goals With his goal today in all competitions I've been doing this job since 1974 And nobody's ever done that in the top division You're going back a long, long time I mean, you know, we've had Postcards of his success through the podcast But That really resonates For me as an amazing landmark 34 in the Premier League, which equals A record that he's bound to break Maybe on Wednesday when we're at the game Yeah We've become so accustomed to watching City over this last few years The passing, the possession Erm The brilliance of it But if anyone ever asked me a question, who would I rather watch Of the two teams that were best in the League For four years, I'd rather watch J\u00fcrgen Klopp's Style of play I like The Manchester City style of play now And this team far more than any of the other Pep Guardiola teams at City over the last four or five Years, because of Haaland That powerhouse, the imperfection Of some of his touches and some of his play You know, and that sounds really sort of Quite derogatory in some ways, but you know, it does Bounce off him sometimes, it is a little bit imperfect He does take risks It's not as subtle and as precise As the rest of the players in the team We've all got perfect technical Ability, but he's a battering ram Of a centre forward, with a brilliant Finish, with something really special And if you're watching him play You are watching something unique You are Same with de Bruyne De Bruyne is unique, but Erling Haaland is Truly unique, a player that Very rarely graces this League, they're usually At Barcelona or Real Madrid In time gone by Maybe in recent times they would be at Paris Saint-Germain But very rarely do we have a player That you would regard as being one of the top Couple in the world, as they arrive We normally have players who are emerging To that after signing in this league It's usually that those players would Go to those other clubs that I've mentioned But I do think there is a world star Here, who has come as a world star and who's Performing like a world star And at this moment in time City have got the treble in their hands They've got some difficult games Against Real Madrid, coming up in the Champions League And they've got a Cup final against Manchester United But on the form that they're in They're very, very dangerous And Erling Haaland is He's got the finishing of Kane The power of Rooney He's unbelievable Even the Brazilian Ronaldo, the power he used to have When he ran, that explosion off the mark He's almost like four players in one And something that During the season, many a question Including myself Does Pep actually like having a player like that? No, because you've watched it sometimes It's looked a little bit Dysfunctional from how Pep Normally likes to play But it looks like That harm is coming at the right point In the season where Those moments that he delivers Contribute so much more To City than when they had the perfection Of everybody else that played And there were people questioning obviously Being allowed to leave and Jesus being allowed to leave But when you saw Akange at left back the other night, defending like he did against Saka And you've seen Ake in the last few weeks And then you see Alvarez today Play like he did Or Haaland Over the season You're starting to think, you know, you think Pep knows what he's doing You know, I think that Manchester City at left back have looked really, really Strong since they've gone to Akange and Ake Whereas before when they had maybe Jouken Sello there Or Zinchenko or Rico Lewis That's not been as solid, so You know, Pep in the end has got there And probably knew what he had in his squad before we did I mean, I was amazed the other night that Akange played at left back But then he had the most incredible fantastic match against Saka Kept Saka as quiet as anybody I've seen And Kyle Walker the same with Martin Ellis So it's all come right for City At the right time, they've started to purr At the moment where you want to And Haaland is just a sensation I hesitate to ask you about Manchester United Because you didn't watch the game today But Bruno Fernandes scored A very important goal But was also, the one bit you have seen Of it was on Twitter One of his teammates having a bit of a go At him, and that brought a smile to you I think Sometimes Bruno Fernandes, obviously Manchester United's Most effective player, Manchester United's best player But then I think every Manchester United fan And probably every player is thinking Just stop moaning It's like I mean I'm on a lot, but I didn't do on the pitch You know what I mean, at my own players And so that's probably the perfect Summary of Bruno Fernandes Today, he's a match winner When Manchester United don't have him in the team They drop levels like you wouldn't believe And we've seen that recently against Sevilla So no It's an important win That for Manchester United today Bruno Fernandes is a star His assists and goals record is Incredible from the position that he plays He always wants the ball, he's got the courage To take the ball, he always fights For everything in a game But maybe one of his teammates Or two maybe, do you need to tell him To stop moaning now and then And that probably to be fair is something he'll take on board If we don't name the culprit, go on social media And you'll find it A couple of things I want to talk to you about Crystal Palace and Roy Hodgson Your old boss Has suddenly turned to be An attacking coach And the goals have been flying in And he's been a short-term fix Yeah, absolutely And I have to say that it looks like Roy's having The time of his life Almost like he's come back in with the freedom The experience, he knows the players Which he thinks is really important And he's like a father figure to those players They trust him I worked with Roy for four years And the players will never say a bad word about him Because they trust him, he's serious about his work He's got them into shape He's got them scoring goals Yeah, we know that Patrick Vieira is a little unlucky That his fixtures he had before he finished Were the toughest fixtures And that the fixtures since were More winnable But we've seen around the teams like Leicester and Everton and Leeds and Forest Losing games We've seen Bournemouth go like that I mean, that's an incredible story But Roy Hodgson's done a wonderful job Just at a time where I think Crystal Palace Needed some experience Steve Parrish and the other owners Didn't want to risk the thought Of going down and thought we just need Somebody who's basically a sure-fire bet To get us Well, maintain our status in this league And that's what's happened And he's an excellent coach and he's had a fantastic career It'll be interesting to see now What he and what Crystal Palace do In respect of at the end of the season And whether it's a cameo That's going to turn into something A little bit longer We'll see what happens Gary O'Neill and Bournemouth They lost Niel here Bournemouth Before Gary O'Neill took over Because Scott Parker was up very early in the season And Gary with no Elite managerly experience And where they are now It is a candidate for manager of the year I was just going to say He probably won't get it But he is a candidate for manager of the year Because we all had Bournemouth going down I don't know anybody Who four or five weeks ago wasn't saying The words Southampton and Bournemouth are gone And then they were thinking like Is it Forest, is it Leicester, is it Everton, is it Leeds Is it West Ham, is it Crystal Palace All those other teams that would get mentioned I'm stunned I'm absolutely stunned by what's happened down at Bournemouth It is an incredible Performance It's going to mean that A club that's bigger on paper Is going to go And it makes it a really intriguing next Three or four weeks at the bottom of the league There will be some real desperation Down there Everton, Leeds Notts Forest, West Ham are still down there That game tomorrow night On Monday night football Leicester v Everton is monumental It's a huge game And the league Title looks like It's going to go towards City But at the bottom You're none the wiser Let's finish off by talking about Somebody who's lived some of his life in Bournemouth Graeme Souness has Said goodbye to Sky Sports Today, his last appearance on Super Sunday Graeme has had a great expression about himself As a proper player, he was a proper manager He's been a proper pundit, hasn't he? Absolutely Martin When I first joined Sky Graeme was The senior pundit And still is the senior pundit Speaks with such authority Gravitas, conviction As an incredible way of Delivering lines You can debate with him And it's no holds barred He can put you on the floor sometimes As he did on the pitch Yeah, he can And he's not worried to say The unthinkable or the unpopular But then you'll shake your hand At the end of a show and you come back the next week And you'll do it again and that's what I've respected Most about Graeme in this last 10, 12 years I think that he's One of the very best That I've ever seen doing the job And something that I and other younger pundits When we first come into it would learn so much from He is a brilliant, brilliant He's been a brilliant, brilliant pundit Had some fantastic nights He's been a brilliant, brilliant pundit And he's really been a brilliant, brilliant pundit He can really bring his own story To his stories in the early days when we go away on Champions League And he would have the meal the night before Particularly when he and Glen Hoddle were there Sat there at the table And they had two very different views on football But he was really interested in listening to them both And I thought those studios I think Jamie Redknapp was in the studio with them at times Or Ruud Huller They always would debate about style of play Glen obviously wanted to see possession and passing through the game as well. But really sorry to see him go, he's been a fantastic pundit, a fantastic person at Sky. I wish him all the very best in the future, I think we're weaker for not having him here next season because of what he brings but that's life, we understand that people move on, it's football but I do wish him all the very best, he's been fantastic with me. I think my last battle with him was here a few weeks ago when Manchester United got beat 7-0 and I had the audacity to say that I didn't think Liverpool played that well which he jumped upon. I still think I was right, you sort of don't tend to win sometimes with Graham and that's the nature of it but yeah I really do wish him all the best, he's been fantastic to work with over this last 10, 11 years. I echo all of that and what an appropriate venue and appropriate game for him to finish with here. Yeah I mean obviously he's seen so much here over his lifetime and obviously the two teams, I mean Graham obviously I think was at Spurs in his early days, he's obviously watched Spurs here today and obviously he was at Anfield, he obviously was a great player here and managed the club as well so for him to finish here on a game like that today whereby the two teams that obviously he has an affinity with as well, there he is just on our screens, I think will be a big moment and there'll be a nice video I think coming up in the next five or six minutes of his best times at Sky or his moments at Sky which I'm sure will get a lot of air time. Yeah go and look for it at the end when you've finished with the podcast and we've finished today Gary, pleasure to talk to you as always.
